# AmongUsMVP
A command line "Among Us" MVP built as a Project for the HY-240 Course on Data Structures of the University of Crete , Department of computer science.

This project consists of two Phases ("Phase A" & "Phase B"). The first one is an implementation of the functionalities described below and its purpose is to demonstrate my knowledge and experimentation in creating some of the basic data structures in C++ from scratch. More specifically:

## Phase A

This phase consists of the following data structures which are used to store various data of the game:

<li> Doubly Linked List with sentinel (used for storing Players) </li>
<li> Sorted linked list (used for storing player tasks) </li>

#### For a detailed explanation of the project, how to compile and run it, see the "phaseA_instructions.pdf" file, owned by the instructor of the HY-240 Data Structures class Panagiota Fatourou <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy240/current/index.php">Course website</a>.
